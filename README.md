# Shopping-Customer-Segmentation
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on customer segmentation for a retail mall, utilizing K-Means clustering to identify distinct groups of customers based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. The goal was to assist the marketing team in devising targeted strategies by understanding the key shopping groups based on income, age, and spending behavior.

**Problem Statement**

The primary objective was to identify and segment the mall's target market into distinct, approachable groups. The segmentation would enable the marketing team to better understand and target their marketing activities. Specifically, the aim was to:

* Identify the most important shopping groups based on customer demographics and spending behavior.
* Create subsets of the market to better tailor marketing strategies.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains the following columns:

* CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
* Gender: Gender of the customer.
* Age: Age of the customer.
* Annual Income: Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars.
* Spending Score: A score assigned by the mall, ranging from 1 to 100, representing the customer's spending behavior.

**Methodology**
1. Exploratory Data analysis involving data pre-processing, data cleaning, followed by univariate and bivariate analysis.
2. Used KMeans Clustering Algorithm to create segments.
3. Used summary statistics on the clusters.

**Results and Findings**

**Cluster Identification**: Multiple clusters were identified, each representing a distinct segment of customers.

* Cluster 1: High-income, high-spending score customers. This group was identified as the primary target market due to their significant purchasing power. Notably, 60% of Cluster 1 shoppers are women, suggesting that marketing efforts should focus on products popular among this demographic.
  
* Cluster 2: Customers with varying income levels but with potential for targeted sales events. This cluster presents an opportunity to drive engagement through promotional campaigns.
  
**Target Group**: Based on the analysis, Cluster 1 was identified as the key target group for marketing activities. Strategies were proposed to attract these high-value customers by tailoring campaigns to their preferences.
